# Vague hero copy — dev spec
Site: allbirds.com · Priority 2 · Urgent · Effort: Low (0.5-2 days)

## Problem
The hero headline 'Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.' is abstract and doesn't directly address the visitor's intent to find comfortable, sustainable shoes, leaving them to infer the value proposition.

## Evidence (from the live site)
> H1: 'Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.' CTAs: 'SHOP MEN' and 'SHOP WOMEN' with no subheadline to clarify the brand's unique selling proposition.

## Current state
h1: Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.; cta: SHOP MEN / SHOP WOMEN; notes: The hero lacks a subheadline that connects the headline to the visitor's need for comfortable, sustainable footwear. The CTAs are generic and don't guide the visitor to a specific product category or benefit.

## Required change
h1: Comfortable, Sustainable Shoes for Everyday Life; cta: Shop Best Sellers; notes: Use a clear value proposition that combines comfort and sustainability, and a CTA that directs to a popular category to reduce friction.
