# Hidden cost: shipping threshold — dev spec
Site: allbirds.com · Priority 8 · Urgent · Effort: Medium (2-5 days)

## Problem
The product page does not display the $5 shipping cost or the $100 free-shipping threshold, so users may be surprised at checkout, increasing cart abandonment.

## Evidence (from the live site)
> The homepage and collection pages show 'Free ground shipping on orders over $100' and the cart drawer shows 'Shipping $5.00', but the product page inventory for /products/anytime-ankle-sock does not include any shipping cost or threshold messaging.

## Current state
h1: Anytime Ankle Sock; cta: Get Notified; notes: No shipping cost or free-shipping threshold is mentioned on the product page.

## Required change
h1: Anytime Ankle Sock; cta: Add to Cart; notes: Add a line near the price: 'Free shipping on orders over $100' or 'Shipping $5' to set expectations early and reduce checkout surprises.

## Acceptance criteria
- GIVEN a first-time visitor on the affected page
